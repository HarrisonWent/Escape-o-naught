New in this version:
-Created and implemented Graphics/art assets for the second level and cleaned it up
-Added Scoring UI in the top left which shows the time limit for the current amount of stars
-Descriptive messages for all block types
-improved responsiveness from the defelctor block

Notes:
-not all blocks have proper icons/objects yet
-sounds are not final and planning on adding more such as atmospheric sounds to levels
-Known issue: going to the menu will start playing music over the music already playing 
-still planning to make level 5 (going to the rocket), its not in this build sorry :/
-planning on adding an indicator for the spawn point of the player
-removed saving/loading levels as it was useless
-the game probably needs renaming since it is no longer a monkey
